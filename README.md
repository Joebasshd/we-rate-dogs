# We-Rate-Dogs Tweets Analysis

This is a Data Wrangling project that focuses on Gathering, Accessing and Cleaning Data

Data was gotten from a Twiiter account [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) that rates submissions of dogs' pictures/videos with an unconventional rating of a higher numerator over a lower denominator. Why? Because "they are good dogs Brent." The data was gathered, accessed, cleaned and insights were derived.
