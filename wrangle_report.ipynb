Next, I applied for essential access in a Twitter developer account but I didn't get approved on-time to I used the tweet_json.txt file provided by Udacity - with the help of the json library I read the data into a list line by line and converted it to a dataframe"

    "After having my three datasets available, I accessed the data visually and programmatically, checking null values, duplicate rows of data, inappropriate datatypes of columns and other issues I could find. I identified eight (8) quality issues and three (3) tidiness issues which are listed below\n",

    "4. Incorrect ratings of 75/10\n",

    "5. Duplicate values in the expanded_urls column\n",

    "6. jpg_url column has duplicated values\n",

    "7. tweet_id datatype should be object\n",
